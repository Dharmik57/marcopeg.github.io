I like to start new project. No, **I LOVE** to start new projects. Starting new
projects give me the opportunity to **go deep into one single subject and learn**.

My [personal github](https://github.com/marcopeg) is filled up with short life span repos.
But some of them are more interesting than others and I plan to keep working on a more
serious level.

Here is a list of the projects that I am actively maintaining, where "maintain" means:

> actively working on features **and documentation**

## LearnJS

On Sundays I help people approaching _Web Development_ from scratch and
_LearnJS_ is the material that I am preparing to make the best of this effort.

There are a few principles that I am following:

- **path of less resistance** - students should not bother with complex setups 
  (at least in the beginning), Internet is packed with incredible tools that
  make learning a fun and simple experience
- **challenge based** - instead of teaching abstract concepts like "array mapping"
  I provide real-world challenges, exercises that becomes progressively more
  interesting (or challenging), but that are always visible and demoable
- **zero teaching** - Internet is full of free valuable resources that a student
  can leverage to learn almost everything. We do our best to curate lists of
  external resources
- **collaborative** - students should be able (and encouraged) to post their
  solutions and discuss it live on the page. I'm looking for ways to integrate slack
  channels into each page

## FetchQ

Fetchq is a Postgres based queue service. It's a task scheduler that handles parallel
queue processing and can scale from a tiny ~20Mb RAM development instance, to a
big scraping project with more than 100 servers working in parallel.

## Stuffer

Stuffer is a file server where you can post stuff. It handles some nice features like
post-upload queued processing, and on-demand processing. Some use cases:

- upload videos that need to be transcoded
- upload images that need to be resized on demand
- upload PDFs of which you want to download only one page every 7

Yes, you can do all the weird things with files that NodeJS allows by writing simple
extensions with the language you love.

We already have some core-extensions that provide caching, S3 file storage and some
image resizing.
