Lately I fell in love with [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) because it offers a straightforward way to compose a
web application through plugins encouraging [_functional composition_](https://joecortopassi.com/articles/functional-composition-in-javascript/)
at feature level.

[ForrestJS](https://forrestjs.github.io/) takes this concept to the next level by offering an interface that _services_ and _features_ 
can use to interoperate without being tightly coupled. It also pushes hard for 
[Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle) and 
[Open Closed Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle).

Today I'd like to share with you a few **running examples** of the services that you can use to compose your webapp.
