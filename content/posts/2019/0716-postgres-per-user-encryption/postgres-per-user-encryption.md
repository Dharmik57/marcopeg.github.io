It's a tough world that we are living into. Users want privacy. **Storing plain data in our _db_ is not enough anymore**.

Crazy, uh?

In this article we will consider a possible approach to improve the level of security and privacy of our storage strategy using
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) as database. We will cover:

- basic encryption
- sandwich encryption
- encryption key migrations

## Preparation

In order to follow the content of this article and get the best out of it, you should be able to run some queries against a
PosrgreSQL database.

> You can run a free PosrgreSQL on [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com) ðŸ¤˜

For the pourpose of this tutorial we are going to read and write some **sensible data that are tied to a user idendity**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    name VARCHAR(255),
    data TEXT
);
```

Write query example:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, data)
VALUES ('marco', 'marco stuff');
```

Read query example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'marco';
```

Update query example:

```sql
UPDATE users
SET data = 'some other private stuff'
WHERE name = 'marco';
```

## Basic Encryption

The general idea with a **basic encryption** is that the way we save data so far is quite open to external access.
I'm not talking about _NSA_ hackers, I'm talking much simpler - every day problem - security stuff.

**What happens if you take a dump of the database for backup pourposes?**
Who can read it? Your employees? Your DevOps only? Is it safe for them to being able to do so? I don't think so.

With the **basic encryption** we are going to **encrypt the `data` column** using a **server password** that you will not
share with your employees. That password should be set as **ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE** and should have different values
between development, staging and production environments.

The first step is to enable the [pgcrypto](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/pgcrypto.html) extension that we will
use to apply a **simmetric encryption** strategy:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;
```

To **encrypt a plain string** with a password you can use:

```sql
PGP_SYM_ENCRYPT('marco stuff', 'key')::text
```

To **decrypt** back to a plain string you can use:

```sql
PGP_SYM_DECRYPT(column_name::bytea, 'key')
```

ðŸ“Œ**NOTE:** the casting between `text` and `bytea` is important to guarantee the expected format of our simple schema.

Now we can simply apply an encryption instruction to our queries:

```sql
-- Insert Encrypted
INSERT INTO users (name, data)
VALUES ('marco', PGP_SYM_ENCRYPT('marco stuff', 'key')::text);

-- Update Encrypted
UPDATE users
SET data = PGP_SYM_ENCRYPT('some other private stuff', 'key')::text
WHERE name = 'marco';

-- Read and decrypt
SELECT
	name,
	PGP_SYM_DECRYPT(data::bytea, 'key') as data
FROM users WHERE name = 'marco';
```

ðŸ“Œ **IMPORTANT:** the `key` should be a fairly robust password that is given to your application as **ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE**.
It should never be hardcoded or commited to any repository, and it shouldn't be distributed to your team members!

âœ… Strengths:

- people (aka: your employees) will not be able to (easily) read into user's data
- **you can store your backups as plain dumps and they are still fairly safe**
- backup/restore operations are easy if you know the encryption key

ðŸ”¸Limitations:

- simmetrical encryption strategies will not stand a serious brute force attack (_NSA_ people will read your stuff)
- encrypted data is not indexable nor searchable
- not so easy to debug (but that is a tradeoff)

## Sandwich Encryption

So far you have achieved a decent level of protection and your user's data are protected from unauthorized access.

**ðŸ””But, the problem now is that you still can read through anybody's data!**

What if you want to guarantee that whatever a single users writes in your system, will remain private to her own eyes?

ðŸ‘‰ The obvious solution is to **use a _per-user_ encryption key**. This could be the user's plain password, or just a _PIN_.
The trick is that this piece of information **should never be persisted into your database**, and not even in your server's memory.

But this is still not enough, because if some bad guy manage to stea the user's PIN and a dump of the database, they will
still be able to decode the data. Here is where the **Sandwich Encryption** comes in handy.

We will take the per-user encrypted data, and encrypt it with the server's production key.

âœ… Strengths:

- **you and your employees will not be able to read what your users write**
- an attacker needs to know both the server's key and the user's PIN

ðŸ”¸Limitations:

- every read/write operation need doubles in complexity as 2 encryption operations are performed
- if the user changes her password, all the encrypted data must be re-encoded

> My personal solution is to store an encrypted hash of the user's encryption key (say her password) in the session's cookie.
> This cookie travels with every request (strictly on SSL), so my server can grab it, decode the hashed pin and use that as per-user key.


```sql
-- Insert with Sandwich Encryption
INSERT INTO users (name, data)
VALUES ('marco',
	PGP_SYM_ENCRYPT(
		PGP_SYM_ENCRYPT(
			'marco stuff',
			'userKey'
		)::text,
		'serverKey'
	)::text
);


-- Update with Sandwich Encryption
UPDATE users
SET data =
	PGP_SYM_ENCRYPT(
		PGP_SYM_ENCRYPT(
			'some other private stuff',
			'userKey'
		)::text,
		'serverKey'
	)::text
WHERE name = 'marco';

-- Read and decode with Sandwich Encryption
SELECT
	name,
	PGP_SYM_DECRYPT(
		PGP_SYM_DECRYPT(
			data::bytea,
			'serverKey'
		)::bytea,
		'userKey'
	) as data
FROM users WHERE name = 'marco';
```

## How to Migrate Encryption Keys

The **Sandwich Encryption** is farily safe. It basically guarantees full privacy to your users unless
your emplyees are NSA undercover agents. Which is quite enough for current _GDPR_ requirements.

**ðŸ””But, what happens when the user changes her password or PIN?**

Well this is tricky as she might permanently loose access to all the data she saved with the old password!

During the password update, we need to use the `oldPassword` to decrypt the user's data, and then the
`newPassword` to re-encrypt it:

```sql
-- Migrate encryption keys
UPDATE users SET data =
	PGP_SYM_ENCRYPT(
		PGP_SYM_ENCRYPT(
			PGP_SYM_DECRYPT(
				PGP_SYM_DECRYPT(data::bytea, 'serverKey')::bytea,
				'userKey'
			),
			'newUserKey'
		)::text,
	'serverKey'
);

-- Read with the new user's key
SELECT
	name,
	PGP_SYM_DECRYPT(
		PGP_SYM_DECRYPT(
			data::bytea,
			'serverKey'
		)::bytea,
		'newUserKey'
	) as data
FROM users WHERE name = 'marco';
```

Depending on the amount of data that your system need to store this **could be a demanding operation**. You might
need to batch this operation to portions of your data and use a cursor to dilute the job in multiple iterations.

> For that purpose you might need to temporarly persist the old/new keys somewhere and this could expose the user's
> data to a degree of risk of unauthorized access, or data loss.

Again, security is a tradeoff!

## How to use Sequelize with Data Encryption?

Raw queries are cool, but if you are a Node geek like me, you are probably using [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/).

Here is some code that you can use to run the example above:

```js
// Returns an instance of the User's Model
// @conn Sequelize connection object
const initUserModel = async (conn) => {
    const Model = conn.define('User', {
        name: {
            type: Sequelize.STRING,
        },
        data: {
            type: Sequelize.TEXT,
        },
    })

    await conn.query('CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;')
    return Model.sync()
}

// Insert data into the User's table
const createUser = (name, data, userKey, serverKey) =>
    User.create({
        name:,
        data:
            Sequelize.fn(
                'PGP_SYM_ENCRYPT',
                Sequelize.cast(Sequelize.fn(
                    'PGP_SYM_ENCRYPT',
                    data,
                    userKey
                ), 'text'),
                serverKey
            ),
    })

// Read out encrypted data:
const findUser = (name, userKey, serverKey) =>
    User.findOne({
        where: { name },
        attributes: [
            'name',
            [
                Sequelize.fn(
                    'PGP_SYM_DECRYPT',
                    Sequelize.cast(Sequelize.fn(
                        'PGP_SYM_DECRYPT',
                        Sequelize.cast(Sequelize.col('data'), 'bytea'),
                        serverKey
                    ), 'bytea'),
                    userKey
                ),
                'data',
            ],
        ],
    })

// Migrate User's Keys
const migrateUserKey = (name, oldKey, newKey, serverKey) =>
    Yser.update({
        data: Sequelize.fn(
            'PGP_SYM_ENCRYPT',
            Sequelize.cast(Sequelize.fn(
                'PGP_SYM_ENCRYPT',
                Sequelize.fn(
                    'PGP_SYM_DECRYPT',
                    Sequelize.cast(Sequelize.fn(
                        'PGP_SYM_DECRYPT',
                        Sequelize.cast(Sequelize.col('data'), 'bytea'),
                        serverKey
                    ), 'bytea'),
                    oldKey
                ),
                newKey
            ), 'text'),
            serverKey
        ),
    }, { where: { name } })
```

## Conclusions

It is definetly not difficult to apply a basic encryption protection on the data that we save in our database.

The level of security that we can handle with the ideas from this article will guarantee that I can not access
my user's data. I am definetly not capable of brute-forcing that :-)

Among other safety checks that you may want to look into there are:

- disk level encryption
- restrict access to ssl connections
- white listing client's IPs
- run your database in a private network
- (I'm sure there are plenty of stuff that I don't know...)
