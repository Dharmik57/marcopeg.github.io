[ForrestJS](https://forrestjs.github.io) provides a set of utilities and starter kits inspired by GatsbyJS, but with the purpose
of **creating Universal PWAs that can run on server, browser and Cordova** native wrappers within the same codebase.

But it's easier done that explained. Open your terminal (we tested this on a Mac) and type:

    npx forrest run my-project

In a few minutes you should have a service running on port 8080:

    http://localhost:8080

And it should be equivalent to the demo that is hosted on Heroku:
