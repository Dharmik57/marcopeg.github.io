![Napoleon Bonaparte](./napoleon-bonaparte.jpg)

This famous quote is often attributed to [**Napoleon Bonaparte**](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/07/06/never-interfere/)
and **it took the greatest part of my life** to finally get to understand the deep implications of the maxim:

1. listen carefully
2. listen _very_ carefully
3. give the speaker the chance to talk some more

Many books refer to it as **active listening**, but I would really you to focus on the word **CAREFULLY**.

It literally means **full of care**. It implies that your involvement in the conversation is definitely not
passive. It is active, hence the _active listening_.

It is active because you are deeply interested in getting anything that your partner is saying, so to
**put yourself in the best spot ever to utter an intelligent reply**.

## Listen Carefully

This truly important when you care about your partner and you want to be emphatic and supportive,
but **it becomes paramount when you are talking with an opponent**. Or an angry customer.

In that cas, you are probably defending your point of view, and your partner is working hard to make her point.

As long each of you is only busy defending your point, there is hardly going to be a winner or a loser.
**You guys are just stalling**, and you can maybe win just by weary out the other guy.

This is very tiresome and inefficient. But the good news is that by listening carefully you can
**outwit your opponent by questioning on her own points**.

## Questions are Key

There are no ways you can convince me that the Earth is a big ball when I'm steady on my idea
that it's flat, and a big wall made of ice circle it to protect us. No way.

Mark Twain used to say: "Never argue with an idiot. They will drag you down to their
level and beat you with experience."

But if you are smart enough to listen to me, listen deeply to my _Flat Earth_ arguments,
you may be able to ask something on the line: "why are shadows changing during the day?"

**Questions will mine your opponent position on a subject using her own arguments against it**.
It's like verbal jiu-jitsu.

## Be Careful!

By practicing **active listening** or **careful listening** you will most likely see
immediate and unexpected results in the conversations you have.

People will likely stop arguing with you. Either will buy into your arguments, or they
will simply stop defending theirs so much. Either way, it will be easier for you.

Never abuse this super-power!

The point is to avoid useless and endless discussions, not just spread your own view
of the world. If I think the Earth is flat, and I'm happy with it... so let be it!
