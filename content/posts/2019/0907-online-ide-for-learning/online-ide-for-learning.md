I've starter to code almost 25 years ago and back then you had to type stuff in a _vim_ like editor
on the black/green CRT screen. You also had to follow **instructions from a book** how to wire up
things so that your _BASIC_ interpreter would be able to run your code.

> Things were not easy and we often felt like ðŸ¤ working with loose cattle.

Welcome to the Future! It's 2019 and today you almost don't need to setup a computer for coding.
[I'm writing this article using a wonderful online IDE (GitPod)](/2019/free-website-with-gatsby-and-gitpod).
Things got easier, **a lot easier**.

Here is my list of tools. I use them regularly to sketch small pieces of my apps, to learn or
practice with new tech, or when I teach to classes.



## ðŸ‘‰ Repl.it

Repl runs a huge list of backend languages.

In this example I'm using [@forrestjs/hooks](https://marcopeg.com/2019/modular-node-apps-with-hooks)
to run a small _Express_ server with two custom routes in _NodeJS_.

  allowfullscreen="true"
  sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"
  style="min-width:100%"></iframe>



## ðŸ‘‰ Codesandbox.io

Codesandbox provides VSCode in your browser. It's powerful and can run more or less
whatever you may think to run with _Webpack_ or similar tools.

  sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe>



## ðŸ‘‰ Codepen.io

Codepen is quite famous for showcasing HTML/CSS/JS frontend stuff. It supports many
different Javascript based languages and CSS pre/post processors.

The best feature of Codepen is the huge amount of available visual examples. It's great.

## More...

There are plenty of other tools out there, these are just the ones I feel more comfortable
with.

And you? What do you use?
