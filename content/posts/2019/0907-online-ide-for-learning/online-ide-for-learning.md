I've starter to code almost 25 years ago and back then you had to type stuff in a _vim_ like editor
on the black/green CRT screen. You also had to follow **instructions from a book** how to wire up
things so that your _BASIC_ interpreter would be able to run your code.

> Things were not easy and we often felt like ðŸ¤ working with loose cattle.

Welcome to the Future! It's 2019 and today you almost don't need to setup a computer for coding.
[I'm writing this article using a wonderful online IDE (GitPod)](/2019/free-website-with-gatsby-and-gitpod).
Things got easier, **a lot easier**.

Here is my list of tools. I use them regularly to sketch small pieces of my apps, to learn or
practice with new tech, or when I teach to classes.
