## Overture

I've been struggling to put together the pieces of documentation that you need to have this working properly.

With hindsight, it was an easy-peasy task, but some of the steps are not so straightforward nor sufficiently explained 
in the projects' docs.

By the end of this tutorial you are running a _Full Stack_ app that can signup/login users and persist
user data in a backend service.

## The Main Characters

[Hasura][hasura] is a real time [GraphQL][gql] engine. It sits between your frontend and [PostgreSQL][pg] database 
and build up a schema that **you can easily query from your frontend** project or other services.

Hasura is Open Source and **you can run it entirely for free** thanks to [Docker][docker] (locally
or on premise) and [Heroku][heroku] (on the cloud).

[Auth0][auth0] is a commercial _Authentication/Authorization as a Service_. It handles all your signup/login
logic for you, and it applies top-shelf safety guidelines.

Although Auth0 is not free, they offer a **generous free-tier up to 7k users** to kick-start your project, and later
on the pricing model is decent. It definitely costs less than maintaining an engineer that focuses on safety!

## The Plot

Here is a brief list of the steps that you are going to take in order to get things up and running:

1. Setup an Auth0 Account & App
2. Setup an Hasura App on [Heroku][heroku]
3. Prepare your backend with users and todos endpoints
4. Configure Auth0 to sync users with Hasura
5. Configure Auth0 to generate an Hasura compatible authentication token ([JWT][jwt])
6. Setup a React SPA on [Gitpod][gitpod]
7. Login/Logout users
8. Persist and query users data from the backend

## Setup an Auth0 Account & App

Head to [Auth0][auth0] home page and signup using one of the available social signup. 

Once you are in, you need to go through a few configuration steps that **setup your first tenant**.
You can consider _tenant_ as a bucket of users, give or take, you will use a new tenant for a new project.

Now you are ready to setup your first app:

1. Go to "Applications -> Default App -> Quick Start"
2. Choose the "Single-Page App -> React" combination
3. Follow the tutorial how to set up your Auth0 App
4. Download the demo app and run it to test it

**ðŸ‘‰ IMPORTANT:** Auth0 comes pre-configured with a generic Google login. Although this will work out of the box,
you will notice that **your app looses the login status at every full-page refresh**. This happens because you 
should fully configure the connection between Google and Auth0 by creating a Google App ID and secret. 

This configuration is out of the scope of this tutorial, and I simply suggest to use the email/password signup/login.
That will work just fine ðŸ˜€.

## Setup an Hasura App on Heroku

This step consists in following the ufficial documentation from the Hasura website:  
https://docs.hasura.io/1.0/graphql/manual/getting-started/heroku-simple.html

I feel this is a **great quick start experience** with the "Deploy to Heroku" button:

1. From the documentation page click on "Deploy to Heroku"
2. Choose you App's name and region
3. Click on "Deploy App" (wait a minute or two)
4. Click on "View App" to open the Hasura dashboard ðŸ¤ª

Can anything be easier than that?  
I don't think so!

**ðŸ‘‰ IMPORTANT:** After you play around with some [basic Hasura introduction tutorials][hasura-basics], I strongly suggest you go through the
[Securing the GraphQL endpoint tutorial][hasura-secret].

_That's all Folks!_ before you move on, I suggest you play around with some basic Hasura tutorials how to build
tables, perform queries and mutations. 

Also you may want to take a read on [Hasura's Authentication and Authorization][hasura-auth] in order to familiarize
with the concept of the [JWT token][jwt] used in the request's headers. It is not a bad idea to play around with 
it to the point that you can manually generate a token on jwt.io and use it to perform some user-level queries.
